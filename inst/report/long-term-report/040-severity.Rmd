# Severity on admission and outcome {#severity .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


The registry adopted, since the beginning, the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) score. The PIM2 variables are
recorded and the risk of death is automatically calculated by the system. In 2013, after a revision of the coefficient of the variables, the new PIM3 score was published. We updated the PIM page with the new formula and since 2014 we calculate both the 2 and 3 version. Moreover, retrospectically, we collected all the new variables and through the new coefficients we derived the PIM3 score for all the patient in the registry.

The Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) was estimated as the ratio between observed deaths/expected deaths.
Expected deaths were derived as the sum of all the PIM scores for each category considered.

The new score seems to perform better than the old one, with a more adequate estimation of deaths and a more
correct SMR.
